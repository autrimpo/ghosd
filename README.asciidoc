*ghosd* is a customizable On Screen Display built with Unix philosophy in mind.
Not quite _suckless_, but in similar spirit.

# Design philosophy
The main goal of *ghosd* is to be simple
yet powerful enough to cover
a wide variety of use cases.
It should provide the user with the capabilities to
display the information they want
in the way they want it.

*ghosd* has no config file,
instead being controlled completly through a named pipe.
This allows for great flexibility
and integration with other tools and languages.

# Usage
A named pipe is created at a specified location,
defaulting to `/tmp/ghosd-fifo`. +
Commands are written to this pipe
delimited by a newline `\n` character. +
If a command requires an argument,
the argument follows the command
on a separate line.

An example sequence, setting the background color and showing the osd window:

    bg
    FF00AA
    show

For a complete command and usage reference, see link:USAGE.asciidoc[the USAGE file].

The default values for all the settings can be changed in `config.h`.

# Building
Building *ghosd* requires the following dependencies:

* SDL2
* SDL2-ttf
* fontconfig

It uses the Meson build system, so an example build might look like this:

    cd ghosd
    meson build
    cd build
    ninja
